# National Park Traveler's Guide

## Description

This is the National Park Traveler's Guide.  It is a guide to every national park located in the Northeast.  Information about the park and weather at the park will be displayed to allow users to make informed decisions about which parks in the region they would like to visit and the best time to make the trip.

Our group chose this project because we enjoy travel and nature, and wanted to make an application that assists any user in finding the right park to visit and the best day of the week to visit it.  It also allowed us to practice coding as a team and repo management.  By the end, our coding, problem solving, gis-use, and teamwork skills all were improved by the experience.
